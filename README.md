# Bible-Explanation-App
This Python program allows users to manage and store explanations for Bible verses. The application utilizes a JSON file to store the explanations, providing flexibility for data persistence.

Key Features:

1. Add Explanation: Users can input details such as the book, chapter, verse, headline, messages, and corresponding explanations. The application checks for existing entries based on book, chapter, verse, and messages, allowing users to add a new date for similar explanations.

2. View Explanations: Users can view a list of saved explanations, including relevant information such as date, book, chapter, verse, and headline.

3. Save Explanations to File: The application allows users to save their explanations to a JSON file for future reference.

4. Delete Explanation: Users can delete explanations by selecting the index of the explanation they wish to remove.

Usage:
1. Run the program, and choose from the main menu options.
2. Add explanations with unique combinations of book, chapter, verse, and messages.
3. View, delete, and save explanations as needed.

Data Storage:
The explanations are stored in a JSON file (bible_explanations.json). The JSON format allows for easy serialization and deserialization of data, ensuring that explanations persist between different sessions of the application.

File Structure:

a. journal_app.py: The main Python script implementing the Bible Explanation application.

b. bible_explanations.json: The JSON file storing the explanations.
